display: flex | inline-flex
flex occupies the entire width
flex-inline wraps according to the content width
flex stretches the content according to the container's height unless the height is specified.

flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse
By default it is row and main axis is left to right
if we specify as column then the main axis is from top to bottom

Wrapping Elements with flexbox:
flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse
Normally if we specify the width then if the content is more than width then a scrollbar is added by default.
flex-wrap is a property that we put on the flex container but not on flex item
By default flex-wrap is set to nowrap

if flex-wrap is set to wrap and flex-direction is set to row, then if content exceeds the specified / availble width then scrollbar will not be added,
instead the content will span across multiple rows

if the flex-wrap is set to wrap and flex-direction is set to column, then the content will go until the specified width , then
any extra content will be added as a separate column.
If no height is specified, then scrollbar will be added and all the content will be in the single column.

if the flex wrap is set to wrap-reverse, then the axis will be from bottom to top and left to right.
